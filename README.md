Statistical hypothesis testing 

 The telecom operator, Megaline, offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

I carry out preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. I have data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. In this project, I analyze the clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.
